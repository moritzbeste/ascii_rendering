Ascii Rendering.

This is a collection of different projects related to rendering objects or images using Ascii characters.

Table of Contents
1. ascii_art:
This is a small project that converts an image to ascii characters based on the brightness of the corresponding pixel/pixels. The resulting string can be displayed on a PDF.
To use this program, sunply provide the following command line arguments: (string) pagesize between A0 and A10,(string) image filepath, (string) output filepath, optinally (integer) fontsize.
2. rotating_polyhedron:
This is a small project that animates a rotating polyhedron in the command line. To use this program, simply provide the following command line arguments: (integer) maximum sidelength of the polyhedron, (float) x rotation angle per frame in radians, (float) y rotation angle per frame in radians, (float) z rotation angle per frame in radians, (string) shape (The currently supported shapes are "cube" and "octahedron", however this may not be up to date, so check the code.), (int âˆˆ {0, 1}) shade faces (here if the value is 0 a wire frame will be rendered and if the value is 1 the faces will be shaded)

To use this project simply clone it and run the programs in the terminal using python. They will also run without command line arguments using predefined arguments. 

These projects were programmed by Moritz Beste.
